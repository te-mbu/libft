# Libft - @42Born2Code
This projects seeks to build on the concepts learned during the c piscine (bootcamp), to code a library of useful functions that will be allowed to be reused in future projects. Because we don't have access to those highly useful standard functions, we have to re-write those functions, to understand them and to learn how to use them currently.
